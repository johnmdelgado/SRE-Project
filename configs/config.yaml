        # ^ asserts position at start of a line
        #     Match a single character present in the list below [ -~]+
        #         + Quantifier â€” Matches between one and unlimited times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed (greedy)
        #         -~ a single character in the range between   (index 32) and ~ (index 126) (case sensitive)
        # $ asserts position at the end of a line
        # Global pattern flags
        #     g modifier: global. All matches (don't return after first match)
        #     m modifier: multi line. Causes ^ and $ to match the begin/end of each line (not only begin/end of string)

        # a single character in the range between(index 32) and ~ (index 126) (case sensitive) This will allow all printable characters (Ascii)
        # added ^ and $ assertions after failed unit test: test_CombinationUnicodeString2
